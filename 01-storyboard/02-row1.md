Successful Deployment of DAMAC: Demonstrated Success of use of DOF Alpha on OSE's D3D

[GitHub - AlexandriaLittle/d3d-pro: The D3D Pro 3D Printer, built from Open Source Ecology designs, modeled in Legacy DOF (Distributed Open Source Hardware Framework)](https://github.com/alexandrialittle/d3d-pro/)

# Frame

Developer's story of finding DOF Alpha

# Benefits

1. Automatic consistency in the resulting documentation

2. Saving development and maintenance time

3. While improving the overall results

# Evidence

1. Show two places where the same content is rendered and the modeled source for that content.  This demonstrates how no matter how many times the content is rendered, it is always the same since there is exactly one version of it in the git repo.
   
   1. Render 1: TBD
   
   2. Render 2: TBD
   
   3. Source: TBD 

2. TBD

3. Resulting [assembly documentation](https://alexandrialittle.github.io/d3d-pro/) is easy to understand and follow. This ease of understanding comes from the documentation's consistent structure for every step in the assembly process, provided by the DOF Alpha model structure and supporting DAMAC workflow. Each step starts with the required tools and materials, then continues with the complete list of precautions associated with the step's required tools and materials, and concludes with the step-by-step procedure to perform the current assembly operation.
