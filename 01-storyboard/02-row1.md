2. Saving development and maintenance time

3. While improving the overall results

# Evidence

1. Show two places where the same content is rendered and the modeled source for that content.  This demonstrates how no matter how many times the content is rendered, it is always the same since there is exactly one version of it in the git repo.
   
   1. Render 1: TBD
   
   2. Render 2: TBD
   
   3. Source: TBD 

2. TBD
