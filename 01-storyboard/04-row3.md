Novel Tools: DOF Initiative Roadmap

# Frame

The Mach 30 team has spent years developing and refining their DAMAC approach for Open Source Hardware, called the Distributed OSHW Framework (DOF).  And over the course of 2025 it has become clear that it is time for Mach 30 to shift their focus on delivering a functional tool to enable more users to get the benefits Ms. Little saw when developing the D3D Pro 3D Printer.  To that end, Mach 30 has launched the [DOF Initiative](https://github.com/dof-initiative) to pull together the development of an initial release of a DOF tool.  

Throwing a hat over the wall... committing to releasing a functional tool at next year's SCALE supporting OSHW and extendable to support other classes of open source projects by the community 

# Benefits

1. Make sharing Models-as-Code in git just work
2. Provide a demo Docs-as-Models-as-Code specification (using OSHW as project type) 
3. Deliver a tool to the community 

# Evidence

1. Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality and documentation of the Models-as-Code library, YAML Datastore (target Q2 2026)
   1. Create: 100% complete
   2. Read: 100% complete
   3. Update: Not yet started (most complicated, includes inserts, modifications, and addressing merge conflicts)
   4. Delete: 33% complete (in progress)
   5. Documentation: 10% complete (in progress starting with on disk representation, trails feature development)
2. Develop DRY LinkML Schema for the Model used to document the D3D Pro, named DOF Alpha (target Q2 2026).  Development begins January 2026. 
3. Integrate YAML Datastore and DOF Alpha into DOF command line tool, m30pm (target release at SCALE 24x)
