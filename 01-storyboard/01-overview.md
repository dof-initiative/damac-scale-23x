# Audience

SCALE 23x <u>Applied Science</u> track attendees.  [SCALE 23x invites presenters](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/23x/cfp) to "share your work on FOSS programs and open hardware projects with the rest of the community, as well as exchange ideas with some leading experts in these fields."  From the CFP page, the <u>Applied Science</u> track covers:

```
Open source is powering a revolution in scientific fields. 
This track explores the practical application of open source 
software and hardware in research, data analysis, and 
engineering. Presentations should detail successful 
deployments, novel tools, and innovative workflows; whether 
analyzing terabytes of data, building custom instrumentation, 
or pushing the boundaries of discovery.
```

By presenting on the *Docs-as-Models-as-Code* (DAMAC) approach, we can cover all three presentation goals:

- successful deployments: D3D project's use of DOF Alpha DAMAC implementation

- novel tools: DOF Initiative tools (including DOF Alpha)

- innovative workflows: the DAMAC approach

# Goal

Establish Docs-as-Models-as-Code as the way to document open source projects (hardware, science, software... everything)

# Title

This Is the Way... To Document Open Source

# Topics

1. Innovative Workflow: Docs-as-Models-as-Code Approach

2. Successful Deployment: Demonstrated Success of OSE's D3D

3. Novel Tools: DOF Initiative Roadmap
