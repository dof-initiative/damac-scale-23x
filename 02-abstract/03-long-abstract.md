# Long Abstract

Early in the development of the [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) [D3D Pro 3D Printer](https://www.opensourceecology.org/d3d-pro/) ([source](https://github.com/AlexandriaLittle/d3d-pro)), the lead developer, Alexandria Little, chose to use an incredibly pre-release set of tooling to create and manage its Open Source Hardware (OSHW) documentation. When asked why she made this choice in spite of its pre-release nature, she reports that the time it took to get over its learning curve was minuscule compared to the time it saved her in developing the D3D Pro. Plus, it enabled her to increase the quality of her work and to get more done with less worry. What was this tool? It was Mach 30's minimum viable implementation of the Distributed OSHW Framework (DOF), their Docs-as-Models-as-Code (DAMAC) for OSHW methodology. And, Ms. Little's tool selection makes the D3D Pro 3D Printer the first demonstrated success of the DACAM approach for Open Source projects that is the heart of Mach 30's DOF.

In this presentation we will take a closer look at Mach 30's DAMAC approach starting with its successful deployment within the D3D Pro project, followed by an examination of the innovative workflow underlying the use of DAMAC, and closing with Mach 30's roadmap for delivering a new open source tool to utilize DAMAC in your own projects.
