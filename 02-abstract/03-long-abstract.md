# Long Abstract

Early in the development of the [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) [D3D Pro 3D Printer](https://www.opensourceecology.org/d3d-pro/) ([source](https://github.com/AlexandriaLittle/d3d-pro)), the lead developer, Alexandria Little, chose to use an incredibly pre-release set of tooling to create and manage its Open Source Hardware (OSHW) documentation. When asked why she made this choice in spite of its pre-release nature, she reports that the time it took to get over its learning curve was minuscule compared to the time it saved her in developing the D3D Pro. Plus, it enabled her to increase the quality of her work and to get more done with less worry. What was this tool? It was Mach 30's minimum viable implementation of the Distributed OSHW Framework (DOF), their Docs-as-Models-as-Code (DAMAC) for OSHW methodology. And, Ms. Little's tool selection makes the D3D Pro 3D Printer the first demonstrated success of the DACAM approach for Open Source projects that is the heart of Mach 30's DOF.

In this presentation we will take a closer look at Mach 30's DAMAC approach starting with its successful deployment within the D3D Pro project, followed by an examination of the innovative workflow underlying the use of DAMAC, and closing with Mach 30's roadmap for delivering a new open source tool to utilize DAMAC in your own projects. 

DAMAC enables users to generate their documentation from a modeled representation of their subject matter.  Generating documentation from a modeled representation leads to the time savings over hand written documentation.  

For the D3D Pro project the time savings took two forms: development time and maintenance time. Development time savings came in the form of fearlessness.  Ms. Little reported experiencing a freedom to experiment with the details of the design and specification.  This freedom came from the knowledge that she did not have to worry about making a mistake in the documentation that would generate hours of mindless work undoing experimental changes since as Ms. Little says, "it would be fixed everywhere in the docs after the next time they were generated."   Development time savings were similarly powered by the universal updates provided when the documentation was regenerated.  For example, changing a details such as renaming a part from "M6 Hex Nut" to "M6 Nut" was nearly instantaneous regardless of how many times the detail appeared in the documentation as the user steps were to make the change once in the modeled representation and execute the documentation generation tool.  

One of the most significant examples of the improved quality of the D3D Pro project provided by utilizing the DAMAC approach is the ease with which end users can understand and follow the resulting [assembly documentation](https://alexandrialittle.github.io/d3d-pro/). This ease of understanding comes from the documentation's consistent structure for every step in the assembly process.  And the consistent structure is a result of the DAMAC workflow's description of how to generate the documentation from the modeled representation's.  In the case of the D3D Pro's generated assembly documentation, each step begins with a listing of the required tools and materials, then continues with the complete list of precautions associated with the step's required tools and materials, and concludes with the step-by-step procedure to perform the current assembly operation.  

Finally, generating the documentation for the D3D Pro is worry free as the generation process never misses a detail, ensuring that no matter how many times a design element is shown in the documentation, it is always the same since there is exactly one version of it in the modeled representation.  For example, The part name "M3 x 10mm Cap Screw" appears times in the assembly documentation.  However, if one examines the modeled representation in the project's GitHub source repo, they will find this string appears exactly once, as the description field in the m3-10mm-cap-screw component's package.json file.
