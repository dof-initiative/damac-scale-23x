# Short Abstract

When Alexandria Little started development on the latest version of the [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) [D3D Pro 3D Printer](https://www.opensourceecology.org/d3d-pro/) ([source](https://github.com/AlexandriaLittle/d3d-pro)), she chose to use the minimum viable implementation of Mach 30's Docs-as-Models-as-Code (DAMAC) for Open Source Hardware (OSHW) methodology to create and manage the D3D Pro's OSHW documentation, in spite of its incredibly pre-release state. Why? It saves her time, improves the documentation quality, and helps her get more done with less worry. In this presentation, we will take a closer look at the Mach 30's DAMAC approach, starting with its successful deployment within the D3D Pro project, followed by examining the innovative workflow underlying the use of DAMAC, and closing with Mach 30's roadmap for delivering a new open source tool that will enable you to use DAMAC for your own projects.
