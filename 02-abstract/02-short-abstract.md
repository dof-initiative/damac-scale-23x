# Short Abstract

Early in the development of the [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) [D3D Pro 3D Printer](https://www.opensourceecology.org/d3d-pro/) ([source](https://github.com/AlexandriaLittle/d3d-pro)), the lead developer, Alexandria Little, chose to use an incredibly pre-release of Mach 30's minimum viable implementation of their their Docs-as-Models-as-Code (DAMAC) for OSHW methodology to create and manage the D3D Pro's Open Source Hardware (OSHW) documentation because it saved her time, improved the documentation quality, and get more done with less worry.  In this presentation we will take a closer look at Mach 30's DAMAC approach starting with its successful deployment within the D3D Pro project, followed by an examination of the innovative workflow underlying the use of DAMAC, and closing with Mach 30's roadmap for delivering a new open source tool to utilize DAMAC in your own projects.
